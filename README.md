## Frequently Answered Questions

### Is this for real?

autoreject.org is an April's fools joke. No reviewer with a clear mind would ever use such a tool, right?  Choose form options and enjoy!


### Where do these text snippets come from?

The "arguments" in the generator all are inspired by real reviews I and some friends got over time.  I am pretty active in the Software Engineering community, hence most of the site applies to arguments and methods in that community.  I'll be happy to include variants specialized for your community - e.g. autoreject.org/medicine, or autoreject.org/law.


### Why a site like this?

With this site, we hope to raise some attention towards the problem of overly formalistic reviews - that is, "reviews" that take only a very shallow, "syntactical" look into a paper without considering its potential and deeper implications.


### Do such formalistic reviews actually exist?

Of course!  As a reviewer, you can always make your life very easy by pointing at one of the "issues" listed on the site.  Ignore the potential of the work, ignore whether it may make some difference or not.  Avoid taking a difficult decision and simply go for the first flaw you can find.

<!-- (will elaborate this further in a blog post)
### Have you used such formalistic arguments, too?

Rarely, but yes.  There's submissions where I as a reviewer feel that these are not meant to advance science, but only for the purpose of getting some paper published. Such work may be flawless, brilliantly written, yet entirely without significance.  Since others will have to cite these papers, to compare against them, replicate them, etc., such papers actually obstruct the scientific progress.  Yet arguing to reject a paper because of perceived lack of significance is lots of effort, hence I am happy if I find other arguments for rejection.

### What are all the possible outcomes?

Feel free to examine the source code; this is where you will systematically cover all possible texts.


### Is there a way not to get your paper rejected?

Yes.  Two, to be precise.
