# Autoreject - An Automatic Review Generator

Are you burdened by writing too many reviews? With autoreject, you can produce long and detailed reviews at the touch of a button, simply by filling out a small form.  [Check it out here!](https://uds-se.github.io/autoreject/)

Of course, this is a joke. No reviewer with a clear mind would ever use such a tool, right?. The "arguments" in the generator all are inspired by real reviews I and some friends got over time. With this site, we hope to raise some attention towards the problem of overly formalistic reviews - and we hope you have some fun, too!
