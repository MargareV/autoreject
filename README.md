## Frequently Answered Questions

### Is this for real?

autoreject.org is an April's fools joke.  No reviewer with a clear mind would ever use such a tool, right?  Choose form options and enjoy!


### Where do these text snippets come from?

The "arguments" in the generator all are inspired by real reviews and arguments I have collected over time.  This includes reviews colleagues and I have gotten for papers of ours, co-reviews of papers I reviewed, and discussions in PC meetings.  I also follow [@ShitMyReviewers](https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks) for inspiration.


### Why a site like this?

With this site, I hope to raise some attention towards the problem of overly formalistic reviews - that is, "reviews" that take only a very shallow, "syntactical" look into a paper without considering its potential and deeper implications.  Plus, it acts as an exercise in rhetorics - namely how to turn any argument into rejection.


### Do such formalistic reviews actually exist?

Of course!  As a reviewer, you can always make your life easy by pointing at one of the "issues" listed in the autoreject reviews.  Ignore the potential of the work, ignore whether it may make some difference or not.  Avoid taking a difficult decision and simply go for the first flaw you can find.


### The form does not really fit to my branch of science.

I am pretty active in the Software Engineering community, and hence the site is pretty much geared towards arguments, methods, and reviews in that community.  I'll be happy to include variants specialized for your community - e.g. autoreject.org/medicine, or autoreject.org/law.


### What are all the possible outcomes?

Feel free to examine the [source code](https://github.com/uds-se/autoreject/blob/master/index.html); this is where you can find all snippets and their conditions.


### Is there a way to get your paper accepted?

Yes.  Two, to be precise.
